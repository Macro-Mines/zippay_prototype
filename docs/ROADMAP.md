# ZiPPaY Roadmap

Planned enhancements and future milestones for the ZiPPaY ecosystem.

## Phase 1: Security & Control (Upcoming)
- [ ] **Daily Spending Limits**: User-defined cap on total watch transactions per 24 hours.
- [ ] **Biometric Lock**: Require phone fingerprint/face ID to enable "Active Mode" on the watch.
- [ ] **Merchant Verification**: Trusted merchant list to skip confirmation for repetitive low-value payments (e.g., Transit).

## Phase 2: Analytics & Engagement
- [ ] **Spending Categories**: Automatic categorization of merchant payments (Food, Transport, Shopping).
- [ ] **Budget Notifications**: Phone alerts when 80% of the daily limit is reached.
- [ ] **Rewards Program**: "ZiP Points" for consistent offline syncing.

## Phase 3: Advanced Connectivity Simulation
- [ ] **NFC Proximity Simulation**: Require the "Merchant" and "Watch" tabs to be within a specific "range" or interaction state.
- [ ] **Multi-Device Sync**: Simulate multiple watches linked to a single smartphone account.

## Phase 4: Hardware Bridge
- [ ] **Bluetooth API Integration**: Move beyond simulated connectivity to use the Web Bluetooth API for actual device-to-device communication testing.
- [ ] **Wear OS Companion App**: Exporting the React components into a dedicated Tizen/Wear OS web wrapper.
